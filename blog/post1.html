        <h2>Welcome to Taalanta Visionaries: Transforming Lives in Githurai</h2>
        <p><em>Building hope, one youth at a time in Roysambu's heart.</em></p>
        
        <p>In the vibrant streets of Githurai 44, something powerful is happening. Young people who society had written off are discovering their potential. Ex-offenders are finding second chances. Drug users are choosing new paths. And our community is becoming a living example of what's possible when we invest in people, not prisons.</p>
        
        <h3>Who We Are</h3>
        
        <p>Taalanta Visionaries isn't just another CBO. We're a movement born from the streets of Roysambu, driven by a simple but radical belief: <strong>every young person deserves an opportunity to build a dignified life.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Our name says it all. "Taalanta" — talent in Swahili — because we know our youth aren't lacking potential. They're lacking opportunities. And we're here to change that.</p>
        
        <h3>What We Do</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>🌱 Youth Reintegration</strong> - We walk alongside young people leaving prison, helping them rebuild their lives with dignity</li>
            <li><strong>♻️ Climate Action & Recycling</strong> - Turning garbage into opportunity while making Githurai cleaner</li>
            <li><strong>🎨 Art & Culture</strong> - Channeling creativity into careers, not crime</li>
            <li><strong>💼 Entrepreneurship Training</strong> - Building business skills for sustainable futures</li>
            <li><strong>🌿 Environmental Conservation</strong> - Protecting our community's future</li>
            <li><strong>💪 Drug Abuse Prevention</strong> - Offering alternatives through talent development</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p><strong>To provide opportunities for individuals to develop their skills, create jobs, and contribute to social and economic progress.</strong></p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Our Vision for Githurai</h3>
        
        <p>We're not just changing individual lives — we're transforming our entire community. Imagine a Githurai where:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Ex-offenders are welcomed back as valued community members, not outcasts</li>
            <li>Young people earn income from recycling instead of crime</li>
            <li>Artists showcase their work in galleries, not just on walls</li>
            <li>Drug abuse is addressed with compassion and alternatives, not punishment</li>
            <li>Every youth knows they have a pathway to success</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>That's the Githurai we're building. Every day. One person at a time.</p>
        
        <h3>Why Githurai 44 Matters</h3>
        
        <p>Githurai is often stereotyped as a "slum," a place of crime and poverty. But we see something different. We see:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Resilience</strong> - People who survive and thrive despite systemic challenges</li>
            <li><strong>Creativity</strong> - Artists, musicians, entrepreneurs innovating daily</li>
            <li><strong>Community</strong> - Neighbors supporting each other in ways wealthier areas have forgotten</li>
            <li><strong>Potential</strong> - Young people ready to rise if given half a chance</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Githurai doesn't need saving. It needs <strong>investment, opportunity, and recognition</strong> of what's already here.</p>
        
        <h3>How We're Different</h3>
        
        <p><strong>We're from here.</strong> Not outsiders doing charity. We're community members invested in our own transformation.</p>
        
        <p><strong>We focus on opportunities, not handouts.</strong> We don't give fish. We teach fishing, then help you start a fishing business.</p>
        
        <p><strong>We integrate, not isolate.</strong> Our programs bring people together—ex-offenders, artists, entrepreneurs, families—building a supportive ecosystem.</p>
        
        <p><strong>We measure success in changed lives, not just numbers.</strong> Every youth employed, every family reunited, every business started matters.</p>
        
        <h3>Our Target Community</h3>
        
        <p>We primarily serve:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Youth (18-35)</strong> seeking opportunities and skills</li>
            <li><strong>Ex-offenders</strong> reintegrating into society</li>
            <li><strong>Young people struggling with substance abuse</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Low-income residents</strong> seeking income-generating activities</li>
            <li><strong>Families</strong> supporting loved ones in recovery or reintegration</li>
            <li><strong>The next generation</strong> who deserve better options than we had</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Our Current Focus</h3>
        
        <p>Right now, we're laser-focused on two critical goals:</p>
        
        <p><strong>1. Integrating as many youths as possible—especially those just released from prison</strong></p>
        
        <p>Every month, young people walk out of prison gates into nothing. No job. No support. High stigma. Within weeks, many are back in crime. We're breaking that cycle with immediate employment in our recycling crews, skills training, and community support.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2. Changing the narrative around drug abuse</strong></p>
        
        <p>We're tired of the "just say no" approach that doesn't work. We're offering real alternatives—art programs, entrepreneurship training, environmental work—that give young people purpose, income, and community. Recovery happens when there's something worth being sober for.</p>
        
        <h3>Get Involved</h3>
        
        <p>Taalanta Visionaries works because of our community. Here's how you can be part of the transformation:</p>
        
        <p><strong>For Youth:</strong> Join our programs. No fees. No judgment. Just opportunity.</p>
        
        <p><strong>For Volunteers:</strong> Share your skills. Mentor someone. Be the support you wish you had.</p>
        
        <p><strong>For Donors:</strong> Support tools, training, and startup kits for our programs.</p>
        
        <p><strong>For Partners:</strong> Employ our trained youth. Buy recycled materials. Commission our artists.</p>
        
        <p><strong>For Families:</strong> If your loved one needs support, we're here. No shame. Just help.</p>
